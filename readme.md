# DefBot

### Discord Bot for the Technical Minecraft Discordserver of the KiwiTech SMP using Discord.js v. 14

This bot aims to provide functionality to control and manage Minecraft servers, aswell as informational functionality for relevant discord-related topics.

Also, this is my first larger Coding Project and this repository will not only help me learn using GitHub, but also track the progess.

If you want to contribute to this project, feel free to PR.

I will soon update this Readme with all the planned functionality for the bot. Once it is finished, this will probably be split up in different individual repositories, because there is a good chance that whoever wants to use this, only needs parts of the program.
