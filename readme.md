#### Discord Bot for the Technical Minecraft Discord Server KiwiTech using Discord.js v14

This bot aims to provide functionality to control and manage Minecraft servers, aswell as informational functionality for relevant discord-related topics.

Also, this is my first larger Coding Project and this repository will not only help me learn using GitHub, but also track the progess.

_This project will - at a later stage - most likely be split up in multiple bots, so it can be more useable for other people._
